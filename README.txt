This is an exploration of the Julia coding language
the compiled nature and extremely fast-ness seems really great, as well as the ease for multi threading, using multiple cores, and the like.
Hoping to push my knowledge of computer science here and also use this to analyze big data sets.
Python, R, and Matlab can all crash if the stuff is too big, so this could be fun AND very useful.
